# ProductCategories

Hi,

All of the framework has been built out for you. Please look at the [Products and Categories for DTCC.pdf] (Products and Categories for DTCC.pdf) for what fields are being asked of you. Use the basic CRUD Repo methods to build our your service.

* Yes nothing will work right now.
* Yes there are errors, you need to fix them.
* Make sure you have re-imported all your maven dependencies before you tell me you have errors. Also you should always enable auto import for maven.
* This is all the direction I am giving you for now. I need you to start being a bit more independent.

#### This will be good practice for you to start thinking about how to design and build an application. You can complain all you want, but you need this practice.
